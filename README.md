# TIC-TAC-TOE

 ## Get started [here](https://carol-kang-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app)

Tic Tac Toe has two players, X and O.
X will start the game by clicking on a square of their choice.
The players will alternate turns until there is a winner.
The player that first gets three squares in a row-column-diagonal is the winner.
