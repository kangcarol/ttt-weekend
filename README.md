# tic-tac-toe starter code

Tic Tac Toe has two players, X and O.
X will start the game by clicking on a square of their choice.
The players will alternate turns until there is a winner.
The player that first gets three squares in a row-column-diagonal is the winner.

Thank you to the anonymous confetti creator! I used it as a starting point and customized it.
